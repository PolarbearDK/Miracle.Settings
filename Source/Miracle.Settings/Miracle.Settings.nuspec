    <description>Load your application settings into strong typed objects with two lines of code.

The advantages are many:
  - It's super simple.
  - No need to write code that load, convert and validate each appSetting.
  - No "magic strings" and no defaults scattered around in your source files.
  - Your application fails immediately upon bad configuration.
  - Get detailed error messages describing exactly which setting has failed.
  - Your settings are always valid.
  - You can use DI to inject strong typed settings into your application.
  - Supports nested objects, arrays, lists and dictionaries.
  - Property validation.
